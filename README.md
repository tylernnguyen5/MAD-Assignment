# Mobile Application Development (High Distinction) - Assignment Semeter 1 2019 at RMIT

## Movie Night Planner Application
I was asked to develop an Android application with MVC architecture to create and schedule movie viewing events, and invite attendees. 

The user interface provides functionalities for: 
- Creating and editing events 
- Adding attendees to the events from their phone contacts 
- Adding date, time and location to the events 
- Viewing the location in Google Maps 
- Receiving location-based notification (with quick-action buttons)

### Dependencies

- Java 
- Android SDK 
- SQLite 
- Google Maps API
- Google Distance Matrix API
